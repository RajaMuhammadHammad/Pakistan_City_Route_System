# Pakistan Traffic City Route System

This project implements a City Route System using C# Windows Forms, integrating Kruskal's and Dijkstra's algorithms for optimal route finding between cities in Pakistan. The system is enhanced with G_MAP integration for visualizing the routes on a map.

## Features
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: For finding the minimum spanning tree and shortest paths.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: For calculating the shortest path between two cities.
- **G_MAP Integration**: For visualizing routes on a geographical map.

## Technologies Used
- C# (Windows Forms)
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- G_MAP API Integration

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RajaMuhammadHammad/Pakistan_City_Route_System.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Run the application to start using the City Route System.
